# Star-Chaser

A python game built using the turtle library. Game features include a menu, keybinds control and a file system to store and display top 5 scores.

Pressing "s" beings the game and a timer starts on top left corner of screen along with score. A round shaped turtle appears randomly on screen and upon clicking it, player gets 1 point. Initially the star appears for 5 seconds. However, each click on star reduces the appearance time by 0.2. This goes on until the appearance time drops to 0.5 seconds.

# Star-Chaser

A python game built using the turtle library. Game features include a menu, a file to store top 5 scores and display them and keybinds change.

Pressing "s" beings the game and a timer starts on top left corner of screen along with score. A round shaped turtle appears randomly on screen and upon clicking it, player gets 1 point. Initially the star appears for 5 seconds. However, each click on star reduces the appearance time by 0.2. This goes on until the appearance time drops to 0.5 seconds. If the star is not clicked within the time, it teleports to a new place on screen randomly. The timer for game is set to 10 seconds.
